organization notes for next week:

tl;dr - this entire directory needs to be repackaged into nice sensible files, junk needs to be deleted,
        and stuff needs to be cleaned out before I merge


end goal 1: make the backend stuff for the controller app
end goal 2: have cv and tesseract pick out buttons and be able to press them off of an image

remove all unused imports!

header ALL FILES! (including hello.py!)

go through and rename classes, methods, and files so they do not conflict and are named WELL!
 - comment all methods, especially the ones in a "cvUtils" class or similar

copy this directory and repackage everything so it can be easily used in the controller app
 - toss controller edited directory in /tapster-3/

#===========================================#

important functions:
- general utilities
  - cvUtils/clearImageBuffer
  - cvUtils/addImages
  - cvUtils/scaleDownFrame
- preprocessing, tesseract text detection
  - cvUtils/preProcessFrame (keep as sample?)
  - cvUtils/processText (GENERALIZE)
  - cvUtils/evalText (RENAME)
- coordinate transform
  - pullCoordinates/transformCoordinates
  - pullCoordinates/calibrateCamFeed (RENAME!)

replace/fix these functions:
- cvUtils/calibFishEyeRemover (BROKEN)
- cvUtils/removeFishEyeDistortion (BROKEN)
- checkAnswer/checkAnswer (RENAME, clarify what it is for)

remove these functions/files:
- test.py (used for fisheye testing)
- calc.py (replace with cv stuff for auto button detection? at least clarify it)

data to store in config files:
- "robot space" coords for calib stick points
- corresponding "cam space" coordinates
  - find a way to merge this and the robot space coords into one json
- fisheye calibration matrices

^^^^Name these files sensibly please!
