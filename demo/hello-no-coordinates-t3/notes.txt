goal: no hard coded coordinates.

DO THIS FIRST!
     VVV

sub-goal: image --> bot coordinates, where you can click in a window and the bot goes to tap there
 - take in image
 - de-fish-eye
 - calibration
    - click on a point on the image
    - use arrow keys to guide robot there
    - hit enter to record position
    - repeat for 3-4(?) total points
 - profit
 - recorder mode? (dumps to .gcode file)

sub-goal 2: image --> tesseract recognition --> coordinates
 - take in image
 - de-fish-eye
 - clean, pre process
 - note coordinates of ROIs?
 - tesseract-ify, find the "order" of the ROIs
 - map the tesseract output to the image itself
 - calibration (see above)
 - profit?
